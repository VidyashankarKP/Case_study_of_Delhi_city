###            **Analysis of Accident Locations on Indian Roads – Delhi Case Study**



#### **Project Overview:**


**This project focuses on analyzing road accident data from Delhi city (2008–2017) to identify accident-prone areas and study fatality trends. Using data visualization and spatial analysis, the study provides insights into accident patterns across districts, victim categories, and vehicles at fault.**



#### **Objectives:**



* **Analyze fatality probabilities across districts and years.**



* **Identify accident-prone zones using spatial data.**



* **Visualize accident trends and variations over the years.**



* **Provide insights that can help in road safety planning and policy-making.**



**Dataset:**

---

**Accident data from 2008 to 2017 for Delhi city.**
